When you learn a new programming language, the first thing you do traditionally is write a very simple program that outputs "Hello World!" on screen. And so it is with my first ever blog post here.

The purpose of this blog is to share my learning experiences with you so that perhaps you may learn as well.

I hope you enjoy the content.
